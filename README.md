# Medicine-Recommending-Vending-Machine


## Work flow of the application

1. Developed a Bluetooth-enabled vending system integrated with a mobile app built using MIT App Inventor

2. The app establishes a Bluetooth connection with the machine, allowing users to select OTC medicines and proceed with payment-driven dispensing

3. Integrated a symptom-based medicine recommendation system using machine learning, specifically tailored for adults

4. Recommends appropriate OTC medicines based on user-reported symptoms before selection

5. Demonstrates end-to-end IoT application involving hardware-software integration, ML-based decision support, and automated medicine dispensing
